Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Project

This project is an implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in the C programming language. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. This project provides a command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher.

Features Encryption: The project allows you to encrypt a given message by shifting each letter a specified number of positions down the alphabet. Decryption: It also provides the functionality to decrypt a previously encrypted message by shifting each letter back to its original position. Customizable Shift: You can choose the number of positions to shift the letters, allowing you to create unique encryption keys.
